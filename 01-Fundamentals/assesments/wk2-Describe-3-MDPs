Forces applied to the cup gripper - eg human taking back the cup when filled

Actions:
Move cup gripper arm in 3D space
Move dispenser nozzle in 3D space
Set instantaneous flow rate of tea being dispensed

Rewards
+1 for each mL of tea dispensed up until 2cm from the lowest part of the rim
-10 for each mL of tea dispensed closer to 2cm from the lowest part of the rim
