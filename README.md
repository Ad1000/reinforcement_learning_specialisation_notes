# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning Notes

My notes from the [Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) from Coursera and the University of Alberta.

They all include pretty $\LaTeX$ formulae.

If above you see `$\LaTeX$` and not pretty formatted text, I recommend [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/details).

I have lifted text and formulae liberally from the sources listed at the top of the course 1, week 1 notes.
